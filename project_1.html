        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Advanced care planning (often used interchangeably with end of life planning) is the process by which decisions are made around what should or should not happen in an individual's end of life care. Advanced care planning is ideally a collaborative process between an individual, their family, their healthcare professionals and their litigators. A number of artifacts are often the result of this planning, most notably Advanced Directives.<br /><br />
          Advanced Directives (ADs) are a collection of documents that should include  designating a durable power of attorney for healthcare (or healthcare proxy) and a detailed living will. In some states, ADs also include official documents, such as Physician’s Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST), that are used in the case of a healthcare emergency to determine a course of action.<br /><br />
          The purpose of these documents is to inform an individual’s family, friends and healthcare providers of their end of life wishes. Information in their ADs range from who should be present at the time of death to whether or not a feeding tube should be utilized when an individual no longer chooses or is able to eat.<br /><br />
          No single, standardized form could likely represent an individual’s decisions around the end of their life - ADs are as unique as the individual preparing them.  However, there are a number of limiting factors that may prevent individuals from preparing any type of artifact for and with their families. A few are detailed here: </p>

          <h3>Disparities</h3>
          <p>According to one study from 2015, a survey of 7,900 nationwide participants revealed that only 25% of participants had an advanced directive. Of that 25%, the majority were white, with only 171 black participants and 178 Hispanic participants having an Advanced Directive. <br /><br />
              In the same survey, 37% of individuals with post graduate education had an Advanced Directive, compared to those with some college education (25.5%) or just a high school diploma (14.3%).<br /><br />
              This indicates that while there is a good understanding of advanced care planning among those identifying as white or those with higher levels of education, disparities related to socio-economic factors do exist in end of life decision making and care. </p>

          <h3>Understanding and efficacy</h3>
          <p>A study conducted in Maryland found that out of 1195 participants, only 34% had ADs. Those without ADs identified lack of familiarity with them (27%), being too young or healthy to need one (14%), or uncertainty of the process for adopting one (11%) as reasons for not having one.<br /><br />
              This finding illustrates a clear disconnect between what most individuals think advanced care planning constitutes and having one in place.
            </p>

            <h3>Addressing unique disease states</h3>
            <p>Good information is available around general advanced care planning and standard Advanced Directive forms.<br />
              However, there appear to be gaps in understanding around advanced care planning for individuals with dementia related conditions. According to Dementia Directive.org, “dementia is the number one reason people lose the ability to guide their own care.”<br />
              </p>

        <p>It is my hope that this project can uncover challenges related to advanced care planning for dementia and create a more holistic approach to end of life planning.
            The objective of my HCD 450 project is to explore access and understanding in advanced care planning in dementia, especially Advance Directive documents and other artifacts, and expand knowledge around what approaches are most beneficial.
          </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand user experiences with advanced care planning (end of life planning) from diverse user perspectives: healthcare professionals, family members, patients, and aging individuals</li>
            <li>Uncover challenges related to standard advanced care planning and specialized advanced care planning, like that for dementia related illnesses</li>
            <li>Discover potential solutions to better equip individuals and their families for conversations and decisions with their health care providers</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The top three codes reflected the ‘storytelling’ or personal testimony aspect of the interviews. Many interviewees provided contextual family history alongside relationship dynamic exposition.

          Approaching sixty, with family history of dementia - was a  full time caregiver for her mother with Alzheimer’s, but recently moved her to an advanced Memory Care facility
          Working understanding of advanced care planning and some knowledge of Advance Directives
          Wonders what can be done for her own health and has a lot of anxiety that she will have Alz as well
          Wants to set up her own family for ‘the worst case scenario’ - doesn’t want to lose her autonomy, but understands that sometimes that is the case
          Is interested in alternatives to traditional ALF or memory care facilities - ‘dementia villages’, as well as complementary medicine
          Somewhat technologically savvy - uses email and Facebook to communicate with friends and family, utilizes online shopping for convenience, but not familiar with cloud based storage platforms. She still prefers to fill out paperwork by hand.
          Her support system consists of her church reading group, a few close friends and her adult children - she also utilizes a support group at her mother’s ALF facility

          Evelyn is a tech savvy, organized professional, whose grandfather passed away last year from dementia complications.
          Her own parents are getting older, and Evelyn wants to be proactive in setting their affairs in order and currently attends her parent's medical appointments.
          Her support network consists of her brother, her husband, her close friends and colleagues.
          She also follows dementia awareness social media accounts and plans to participate in the 'Walk for Alzheimer's' later this year.

            <p>Despite measured success of advance directives in easing patient and caregiver burden in end of life planning, there are still a number of limiting factors:

                <li>Lack of understanding</li>
                <li>Barriers to access</li>

                  <li>Sample group for this research project did not encompass a diverse user group</li>
                  <li>Instead utilized  Value Sensitive Design as my design approach to “account for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design sprint process”</li>
                  <li>Time constraints forced shift to lighter ‘design deliverables’</li>
