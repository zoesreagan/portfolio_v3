        <article class="Bio">
          <p>
          I have a professional background in clinical and patient education project management, most notably initiating a pilot education program to provide outreach and support to people with Parkinson's Disease and their care partners using novel, technology based outreach methods. <br /><br />
          In my time as a digital project manager, I have directly impacted the growth and development of our UX team, while managing complex digital projects in education, non-profit and commercial sectors. <br /><br />

          I am a full time graduate student in the Human Computer Interaction Master's program at DePaul University. My research focuses on creating intersectionally sensitive solutions to complex identities and cognitive states, based on my own experiences and those of my family.<br /><br />

          I have a personal interest in ecology, anarchy and indigenous ways of knowing. I actively anticipate the end of capitalism as the primary technological paradigm, and seek fellowship with others who share an 'outside the window' approach to design & technology. <br /><br />
